THIS WEEK:



4D. Assignment 1 spec says: "Wherever necessary, you need to use the inheritance and/or aggregation concept of OOD." We already have Inheritance (Vehicle, Car, Truck). Let's add Aggregation to cover all bases.

Suggest adding a Manufacturer class: name field, and all of the usual constructors, setters / getters (Mutators / Accessors), toString. Update Vehicle class to include a Manufacturer object, and update constructors and toString(), and add settter and getter for Manufacturer.

For each Vehicle, Car, Truck we add, user must also select a "Manufacturer" from a combobox, and this needs to be stored for each Vehicle.

TODO: students to update Manufacturer class to include: location, phone number, email, web site, fields, with setters, getters, update the Consttructors and toString(). Update "Manufacturer" combobox to include name and location so user can select a manufacturer based on their location.
